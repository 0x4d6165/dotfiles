This repo includes my tmux.conf and vimrc along with the scripts used in said tmux.conf. **Note:** my vimrc is using [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) so don't just copy and paste it without installing vundle (also directly copying a vimrc is usually not a good idea).

##Fonts
The vimrc and tmux.conf files require patched fonts in order to be displayed correctly. I recommend [DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono) but you can find patched versions of many more fonts in that repository.
